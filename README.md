# C-Sharp memo 
This is just a small memo file to help me get used to some of the higher level concepts in C-Sharp.

At this point in time. The file contains entries about:

- Method overloading
- Method overriding
- The use of properties
- Generics
- Inheritance
- Constructors
- Interfaces
- The "abstract" keyword
